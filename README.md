# DevelopmentBooks

There is a series of books about software development that have been read by a lot of developers who want to improve their development skills. Let’s say an editor, in a gesture of immense generosity to mankind (and to increase sales as well), is willing to set up a pricing model where you can get discounts when you buy these books. The available books are :

1. Clean Code (Robert Martin, 2008)
2. The Clean Coder (Robert Martin, 2011)
3. Clean Architecture (Robert Martin, 2017)
4. Test Driven Development by Example (Kent Beck, 2003)
5. Working Effectively With Legacy Code (Michael C. Feathers, 2004)


# Rules 

One copy of the five books costs 50 EUR.

- If, however, you buy two different books from the series, you get a 5% discount on those two books.
- If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.
- If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.
- If you go for the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25% discount.
- Note that if you buy, say, 4 books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the 4th book still costs 50 EUR.

# For Example
If the shopping basket contains the below books.

2 copies of the “Clean Code” book
2 copies of the “Clean Coder” book
2 copies of the “Clean Architecture” book
1 copy of the “Test Driven Development by Example” book
1 copy of the “Working effectively with Legacy Code” book
We can avail the discounts for above shopping basket containing 8 books by grouping [5,3] or [4,4] or [3,3,2], etc. Output should be 320 EUR as the best price by applying [4,4] as below.

(4 * 50 EUR) - 20% [first book, second book, third book, fourth book]
(4 * 50 EUR) - 20% [first book, second book, third book, fifth book]
= (160 EUR + 160 EUR) => 320 EUR
# Purpose

Develop a java application in TDD fashion (**Test-Driven-Development**) for shopping cart books with discount and get the best calculated price based on the available discounts with respect to unique number of books quantity 

# Tools used for developing this application 

- **Backend** : Java 8 & Springboot 2.7

- **Build tool**: Maven 4.x

## How to build the application


* Clone this repository
```
https://github.com/2023-DEV1-074/DevelopmentBooks
```
*  ```mvn clean install``` for building this project

## How to run the application

 ```java -jar target\developmentbooks-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```
							
	

* By default the application will start on **port 8080**. If you want the application to run on different port 8082, you can pass additional parameter **--server.port=8082** while starting the application
  you can update the **server.port** in **application.properties**
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of this commands:
* 
  ```java -jar target\developmentbooks-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=<port number>```

Once the application runs you should see below message in console log

```
